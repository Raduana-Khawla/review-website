## Importance of madrasah learning

#Madrasah education makes a man pure. It makes a society beautiful. It saves us from the path of evil and devil. It leads us to the path of peace and heaven. This system of education helps us to be spiritually developed and to make a close connection with the Almighty Allah.
The system in which mainly the principles of the Quran, hadith, and fiqh are taught is called madrasah education, in other words, madrasah education means Islamic education. In our country, there are two systems of madrasah education. In the Alia Nesab general subjects such as English, Bengali, mathematics, science, geography, social studies etc. are also taught in the light of Islam. But in the Kaomi Nesab mainly the Quran, the hadith, and fiqh are taught. Firstly, we know that Allah said in the holy Quran, “read in the name of the Lord who had created you.” This call of Allah can be obeyed by learning Islamic lessons which are taught in the madrasah education. Secondly, our prophet (SM) said, “Acquiring knowledge is compulsory for every man and woman.”
